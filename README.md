## constructive criticism by Marcus Augustsson

- add linebreaks to make the array more readable.
- maybe a comment about what type of data in the arrays.
- index.php could use a few comments on <article>  and  <nav> just somthing to say "this is , and it does, " otherwise nice setup for a article page, easy to read.
- it's recomended to have the link script in bottom of body but i could be wrong with logos or script links for other pages but it' s  somthing to think about.
- maybe a more specefik explantion of what "getAuthorName" does.
    Conclution: nice work 5/5 :+1:
